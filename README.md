# ChatGPT manipulation

So now I will frame my work as ChatGPT-driven manipulation.

# Develop plan:

I want to see this work before April. That's all I want to do. 

## Perception

For perception side, I want it to be as general as possible. I want it to be a hierachical structure. I want to involve Detic, hierachical perception structure: Segmentation, 2D tracking and 6D tracking. Perception selection can be .txt, json, xml and etc.

## Manipulation

For manipulation, there should be a lot of pre-defined behaviour:

- [ ] Grasping
- [ ] Pickup
- [ ] Push
- [ ] Put down.

Either of them can be pretrained policy or hand-crafted policy. 

# Todo:

- [x] Change the camera position.

# Challenges

A real challenges is that: how you can represent the 6D orientation.
